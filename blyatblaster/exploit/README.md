Serve exploit.html on a webserver

This is a POC which relies on local requests not being blocked. 

The docker image which was used to make the challenge was on 89 but was updated to chrome v99 a few days before the competition.

To exploit it *with* chrome 99 is still possible but a bit more blind/slow
